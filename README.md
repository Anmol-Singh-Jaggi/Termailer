termailer
=========

python script to send email from terminal (currently for gmail only)

In the current version you can send mails to as many people you want but you can attach only one attachment 
and the sender's account should be gmail.

In the further versions you can expect memoisation of :
* user accounts
* recipents
* attach more than one 

list will be further updated .

Thanks!
